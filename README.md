This repository is made for some tests with Twitch API and website.
In the beginning, I prepared the integreation test.
The "twitch-test.spec.js" file has a simple test for comparing UI and API representation of top 20 games on the Twitch platform in current time.
The idea is to prove the equality of the UI and API representation of this list.
